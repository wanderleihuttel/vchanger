vchanger ChangeLog

1.0.3 (2020-05-06)
  - Redesign locking mechanism for multiple instances using POSIX
    semaphores.
  - Use at, rather than nohup, in scripts invoked by udev rules to fix
    nohup not working as expected on some platforms.
    (Patch from Steven A. Falco)
  - Add spec file for Fedora 29 (Provided by Steven A. Falco)
  - Correct number of slots reported by SIZE command (Fixes bug 17)
  - Rename logging variables that conflict with cmath's log function (Fixes bug 18)
1.0.2  (2018-06-14)
  - Use named mutex to prevent instances of vchanger invoked by Bacula during
    a bconsole call from initiating further bconsole calls. Prevents a race
    condition caused by the need for Bacula to invoke additional instances of
    vchanger when vchanger invokes bconsole to issue 'update slots' and
    'label barcodes' commands. (Fixes bug 15)
  - Prevent load command from loading the same virtual slot into more than
    one virtual drive. (Fixes bug 13)
  - Fix bconsole update slots command needs drive to be specified. [Patch
    from Bill Arlofski] (Fixes bug 14)
  - Improve generated volume label format. [Patch from Wanderlei Huttel]
  - Additional logging to help debug udev/UUID assignment problems
1.0.1  (2015-06-09)
  - When looking up the mountpoint of a magazine by UUID with libudev,
    also look for mountpoint of device alias names in DEVLINKS in addition
	to the DEVNAME.	(Fixes bug 12)
  - The f_mntonname field in struct statfs was misspelled, causing a compile
    error on BSD systems. (Fixes bug 10)
  - Use static linking of libwinpthread on Windows builds to prevent missing
    libwinpthreads-1.dll error. (Fixes bug 11)
  - Set signal handler for SIGPIPE to SIG_IGN and do not reacquire process
    lockfile when deleting the update lockfile. This should prevent a race
    condition in vchanger when Bacula invokes other instances of vchanger
    recursively when an 'update slots' or 'label barcodes' command is issued
    via bconsole. (Fixes bug 9)
  - Fixed nsis script error causing Windows installer to install incorrectly
    for 64-bit Windows and fail to create Start Menu items. Also now correctly
	removes itself from the Installed Programs list when uninstalled.
1.0.0  (2015-04-14)
  - Major change to magazine and work directory structure.
     - Virtual drive symlink points to volume file directly
     - All drive and magazine state info kept in work directory
     - Magazines have a dynamic number of virtual slots corresponding
       to a variable number of volume files
     - Volume files may be moved from one magazine to another
  - Allow an unlimited number of virtual drives
  - Add ability to issue 'update slots' and 'label barcodes' commands
    to Bacula to support plug-n-play of removable drives
  - Add support for undocumented Bacula Autochanger Interface command LISTALL
  - Added extended API command CREATEVOLS to allow creating and labelling
    volume files with a single command.
  - Added extended API command REFRESH to support plug-n-play of removable
    drives
  - Removed deprecated extended API command INITMAG
  - Add udev support for finding devices by UUID
  - Increased amount of logging
  - Enable use of getfsstat() for finding mountpoint by UUID to support
    building for BSD / OSX
  - Allow building without UUID capability to support minimal systems having
    neither libudev nor libblkid/libuuid.
  - Changed Windows version requirement to Server 2008+ / Vista+
  - Allow cross-compile of 64-bit Windows target
0.8.6  (2010-05-13)
  - Use opendir instead of stat to trigger automounts
  - Add ability to configure logging level
  - Add extensive logging output to enhance debugging
  - Maintain persistent magazine bay state to prevent magazines
    in multi-magazine changers from inadvertently being moved
    when a lower numbered bay has its magazine detached.

  - Fix esfsprogs link errors on some Linux distros (bug 2941290)
  - Merge "safe strncat" patch

  - Fix libblkid linking for FreeBSD (bug 2872006)
0.8.3  (2009-10-27)
  - Add specification of magazines by partition UUID
  - Add LISTMAGS command to list magazines assigned to an autochanger
  - Empty, rather than delete, loadedN files to prevent out of space
    error on magazine partition
  - Fix error parsing index files. (bug 2785183)

    drive when last invoked
