.SH "NAME"
vchanger.conf \- configuration file for *vchanger(8)*
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
/etc/vchanger/vchanger\&.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBvchanger(8)\fR is passed the path to a configuration file as its first positional parameter\&. The file contains keyword\-value pairs, specified by the free\-form syntax \fIkeyword\fR = \fIvalue\fR\&. Keywords are case\-insensitive and embedded whitespace is ignored\&. For example, "LOGLEVEL" is equivalent to "Log Level"\&. Values are case\-sensitive and embedded whitespace is preserved, however leading and trailing whitespace is ignored\&. Values may be one of the following types:
.PP
BOOLEAN
.RS 4
The case insensitive strings "true", "yes", and "1" are accepted as a true value, and "false", "no", and "0" as a false value\&.
.RE
.PP
INTEGER
.RS 4
A numeric integer value
.RE
.PP
PATH
.RS 4
A filesystem path\&. If the path does not begin with a
\fI\*(Aq/\fR\*(Aq character, then the path is considered a relative path\&. The directory to which the path is relative is described for the relevant keyword in the
\fBCONFIGURATION SETTINGS\fR
section\&.
.RE
.PP
STRING
.RS 4
A text string\&. The string may be enclosed in double quotes\&. A quoted string may also contain escape sequences\&. An escape sequence begins with the back slash character \(oq\e\(cq\&. Valid escape sequences are \ea, \eb, \en, \er, \et, \ev, \e\e, and \e", and are interpreted as in the C language\&.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION SETTINGS"
.PP
\fBbconsole\fR = \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the path to the bconsole utility used to interface with the Bacula console\&. If given as a relative path, standard shell path search semantics apply\&. Specifying the empty string "" disables the sending of commands to Bacula\&. The default is "bconsole"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBbconsole config\fR = \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the path to the bconsole configuration file to use when invoking bconsole\&. The path is passed to bconsole using its \-c flag\&. If the empty string "" is specified, then bconsole is invoked without the \-c flag\&. The default is ""\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDefault Pool\fR = \fISTRING\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the name of the pool into which newly created volumes should be placed when labeling the new volumes via bconsole\&. The default is "Scratch"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGroup\fR = \fISTRING\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the group that
\fBvchanger(8)\fR
should run as when invoked by the root user\&. The default \-s "tape"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLogfile\fR = \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the path to the vchanger logfile\&. If a relative path is specified, then it is relative to the directory defined by the
\fBWork Dir\fR
keyword\&. The default is a file name that is the string "\&.conf" appended to the value of the
\fIStorage Resource\fR
keyword in the
\fIWork Dir\fR
directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLog Level\fR = \fIINTEGER\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the amount of logging desired\&. The value is an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive, corresponding to the LOG_EMERG through LOG_DEBUG log levels defined in
\fBsyslog(3)\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMagazine\fR = (\fIPATH\fR or \fISTRING\fR)
.RS 4
Specifies a directory or file system that contains volume files that the changer specified by the
\fBStorage Resource\fR
keyword may use\&. this keyword may appear more than once in the configuration file in order to specify multiple magazines\&. Mounted file systems may be specified by prepending the string "UUID:" (case insensitive) to the UUID of the file system\&. Otherwise, the value specifies the path to a directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBStorage Resource\fR = \fISTRING\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the name of the Storage resource, defined in the Bacula Director daemon\*(Aq\*(Aqs configuration file (bacula\-dir\&.conf), that is associated with this changer\&. The default is "vchanger"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBUser\fR = \fISTRING\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the user that
\fBvchanger(8)\fR
should run as when invoked by the root user\&. The default is "bacula"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWork Dir\fR = \fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the path to the work directory
\fBvchanger(8)\fR
will use for this changer\&. The default is a sub\-directory of /var/spool/vchanger named as the value of the
\fBStorage Resource\fR
keyword\&.
